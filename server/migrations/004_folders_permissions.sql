-- Migration 004 — folders and per-folder permissions.
--
-- Until now documents were a flat list with a text path, and the only access control was a
-- global role. Real work is organised as folders (a submission, a product, a section) with
-- different people allowed into each, so access is granted on the folder and inherited by
-- everything inside it.
--
-- Resolution order for "can this user do X here":
--   1. Global `admin` role wins outright.
--   2. Otherwise walk up the folder chain and take the NEAREST explicit grant.
--   3. No grant anywhere on the chain means no access — deny by default, which is the right
--      posture for regulated content.
