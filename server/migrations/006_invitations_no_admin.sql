-- Migration 006 — invite by email, and remove the admin concept.
--
-- Two changes, both simplifications:
--
-- 1. You invite an EMAIL, not an account. The person may never have opened AmFile. The
--    invitation sits pending and is claimed automatically the first time someone signs in
--    with that address, so the inviter never has to know or care whether they had an account.
--
-- 2. There is no global administrator. A project belongs to whoever created it, and access is
--    only ever what an owner granted. Nobody sees a project because of a role.
--
--    Worth stating plainly: this also means that if the sole owner of a project leaves the
--    company, nobody can reach that project any more. There is deliberately no override.
--    Adding a second owner is the only recovery path.
