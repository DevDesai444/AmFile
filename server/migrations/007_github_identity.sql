-- Migration 007 — GitHub is the identity, and roles are gone.
--
-- Identity
-- --------
-- AmFile no longer issues accounts. You sign in with GitHub; the email GitHub gives us is the
-- identity, and that is what invitations are addressed to. A user row is created on first
-- sign-in rather than by an administrator, which is what makes "add someone by email before
-- they have ever opened AmFile" work end to end.
--
-- 11.100(a) still holds: a user row is never reused or reassigned. github_id is GitHub's
-- immutable numeric id, so renaming a GitHub account does not create a second identity, and
-- somebody taking a freed-up username cannot inherit an existing one.
--
-- Roles
-- -----
-- user_roles and amfile_role are dropped. Nothing reads them any more: what you may do is
-- decided per project by its owners (migration 006), and a global role was the last remaining
-- way to see a project nobody invited you to.
