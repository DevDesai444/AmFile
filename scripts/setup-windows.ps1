  AmFile — one-shot setup for a Windows machine.

  Installs what is missing, clones AmFile to the Desktop, configures it, and starts it.
  Safe to run again: an existing clone is updated rather than replaced, and anything already
  installed is left alone.

  Run it with:

      irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevDesai444/AmFile/main/scripts/setup-windows.ps1 | iex

  Overrides, if ever needed, are environment variables rather than parameters — a param block
  behaves inconsistently when a script is piped into iex, and this script is meant to be run
  exactly that way:

      $env:AMFILE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = 'Ov23...'
      $env:AMFILE_TARGET = 'C:\dev\AmFile'
#>

# Native tools such as git write progress to stderr. Under 'Stop' some PowerShell hosts treat
# that as a terminating error, which would abort a perfectly good clone, so ordinary output is
# not allowed to be fatal — failures are checked explicitly through $LASTEXITCODE instead.
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'

# Public by design: the device flow has no client secret, and any client id ships inside the
# desktop app anyway, so this is not something that can be kept private.
$ClientId = if ($env:AMFILE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID) { $env:AMFILE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID } else { 'Ov23liGwgNrBrhj8UZP8' }
$RepoUrl  = if ($env:AMFILE_REPO_URL) { $env:AMFILE_REPO_URL } else { 'https://github.com/DevDesai444/AmFile.git' }
$Target   = if ($env:AMFILE_TARGET) { $env:AMFILE_TARGET } else { Join-Path ([Environment]::GetFolderPath('Desktop')) 'AmFile' }

  npm has to be invoked as npm.cmd, not npm.

  Typing `npm` in PowerShell resolves to npm.ps1, and on a machine with the default execution
  policy that file is refused: "running scripts is disabled on this system". npm.cmd is a batch
  file, which the execution policy does not govern, so it works without asking anyone to weaken
  a security setting they may not be allowed to change anyway.
